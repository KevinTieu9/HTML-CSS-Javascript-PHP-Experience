Website is best view with a browser window of 1280 x 658 or larger
Any screen resolution that is smaller may cause images to move around due to not enough screen space
I would assume learning responsive design will occur as we learn more about it during the semester.-->

<!--I originally had an audio file put onto this page, but because nrs was taking a long time
(if ever, loading the audio file..... it works at the local level though. Either way, 
I took it out.....it had javascript to lower volume control

So, if you want, please follow this link to listen to it while reading

			   <b>About Me</b><br/>
			   <p align="left">
			   </ul>
			   <li>My name is <b>Kevin Tieu</b>, I was born and raised in <b>Sacramento, California</b>, United States.</li><br/>

			   <li>Some of the things I like about my city is that the weather here is nice most of the time,<br/>
			   the city is just a bit above an hour to the closest mountain (for snow), above an hour to the sea,<br/>
			   and that this city is the Capitol of California.</li><br/>
			   
			   <li>In my free time, I like to tinker with computers, watch animation, play video games, and go on hikes.</li><br/>
			   
			   <li>I am currently a student at Humboldt State University studying in Computer Science. <br/>
			   I currently have some working knowledge of HTML/CSS, C++, C#, Java,and Python.</li><br/>
			   
			   <li>Before coming to Humboldt State University, I attended California State University Sacramento.<br/>
			   I graduated with a Political Science degree along with a membership into Pi Sigma Alpha, <br/>
			   the National Political Science Honor Society for esteemed Political Science Students.</li> <br/><br/>
			   
			   <li>With the changing times, as well as how greatly Computer Technology has affected the lives of<br/>
			   billions of people around the globe, I found interest in, and decided to pivot my career goals,<br/>
			   to having better knowledge of Computer Science and applying that knowledge to every day events.</li> <br/>
			   
			   <li>My biggest objective with this degree is working with AI and Data Science, 
			   as they are drivers to knowing the human condition 
			   and in finding knowledge that humans have yet to discover in both the small and grand scale.</li>
